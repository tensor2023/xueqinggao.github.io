## Hi, I’m Xueqing Gao

**2025.9.23–2025.9.27 I will be at MICCAI 2025 — feel free to come chat with me!**  
📧 **Email:** [xqgao_tj@outlook.com](mailto:xqgao_tj@outlook.com)
![Me](Me.jpg)
I’m currently pursuing a second Bachelor's degree at Tongji University and working as a visiting student in the **Haibin Ling Lab** at Westlake University.  
My research interests lie at the intersection of **optics and machine learning**, focusing on **physics-based vision** and **inverse problems**, including computational imaging beyond physical limitations, reconstruction, optimization, and interpretability.  

I graduated from Tongji University in **July 2025** with a Bachelor's degree in **Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering**, and previously conducted research as a visiting student in the **Yuchuan Qiao group** at Fudan University.  

**<span style="color:red">I am currently looking for PhD positions starting in Spring/Fall 2026.</span>**
